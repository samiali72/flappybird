# Description

The project ‘FLAPPY BIRD’ is a game where the user or player has the control over the movement of the bird. The bird has to fly in a space full of obstacles and reach to the end point of the game. The speed of the bird keeps increasing after every +5 points, which makes it interesting and harder. 
The player has to press and hold the spacebar key to control the height of the bird in which its flying, the space has green bars from which the bird has to go through without touching them. If the bird touches it, it either exits the game or detects the point.
In short the player has to fly the bird without getting it hit by the obstacles to win.
